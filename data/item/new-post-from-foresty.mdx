### Bootstrapped and independent

When we say that our customers come first, it’s not just some flowery mission statement, it’s how we’ve operated from day one.

We don’t have investors who are looking for huge returns, and there are no stakeholders other than the two partners ([**Jack Ellis**](https://twitter.com/jackellis) and [**Paul Jarvis**](https://twitter.com/pjrvs)). We’re profitable, pay ourselves a full-time salary, and focus on making Fathom amazing for the folks who use it.

Fathom has always been bootstrapped, fiercely independent and fully self-funded. The only people we answer to are our customers.
